This is a fun project I worked on to practice my Javascript, HTML and CSS skills. The aim of the game is to defeat the pc opponent 100 times to save the world. The player will choose a move: shield, wand or sword,  and the ai will randomly select a move. Shield beats sowrd, wand beats shield and sword beats wand, upon resolution the defeated player loses one life, if a draw occurs, neither player takes damage. Each player has five lives per round, the player has a vitality potion to heal all their lives. If player loses all their lives the game ends and will reload after eight seconds. After each round victory the slaughter count increases, the villain will rise again and each player will fully recover their lives and the players vitality potion will also refresh. At 50 slaughter count the bgm will change. Once the player defeats the ai 100 times, the world is saved and the game will reload after eight seconds.
